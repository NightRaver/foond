Android Application

Ever wondered what's good to eat nearby? This android application is the solution for this problem.

This is an app (in-progress) that will display pictures of different images (uploaded by the user) in a grid view format of food nearby your geographical area. This app uses the Yelp API to populate the nearby restaurant and users are allowed to select the restaurant of where they got their food image from. The picture is then stored in the amazon S3 where it will be displayed via Picasso later.

Main Goal:
To provide an app that allows user to quickly choose where to go eat without having to decide which restaurant to go to.

Future Add-Ons:
- Allow user to select the radius of the food images that can be displayed.
- Having a 'search' feature for yelp searches.
- Fixing up the UI.
- Progress wheel when loading up food images.
